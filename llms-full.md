## Design Principles

A few core principles shape how the Arkham API is designed and how Arkham intelligence should be used.

## Entity-First, Not Address-First

Arkham is built around **entities** (real-world actors), not isolated wallet addresses. Addresses are often disposable; entities persist. The API is optimized to help you understand activity at the **actor level** and then drill down into underlying addresses when needed.

## Explicit Confidence, Not Implied Certainty

Attribution is treated as a **confidence-scored** problem, not a binary claim. Arkham distinguishes between higher-confidence verified labels and lower-confidence predictive attribution, so consumers can make informed decisions and apply appropriate corroboration.

## Labels as Living Intelligence

Labels and entity composition evolve as new signals emerge and attribution improves. Arkham intelligence is continuously updated, and the API is designed to support workflows that account for **ongoing enrichment and corrections** over time.

## Coverage Without Hiding Uncertainty

Arkham aims for broad coverage while being transparent about what is known versus inferred. Where attribution is probabilistic, the system surfaces that uncertainty rather than hiding it, enabling users to balance **coverage, confidence, and risk** according to their use case.

---

See the [Data Model](/concepts/data-model) section for more details on how Arkham attribution coverage should be interpreted, including how to interpret labels vs. prediction labels, how Arkham represents confidence in attribution, and how to incorporate those signals into production workflows.

## Who This API Is For

The Arkham API is built for teams that need **production-grade blockchain intelligence** inside their own products, pipelines, and investigative workflows. It provides direct programmatic access to the same intelligence layer that powers the Arkham platform, including entity attribution, labels, tags, transfers, wallet clusters, and entity predictions.

At the core of the API is **ULTRA**, Arkham's proprietary address-matching engine. ULTRA links blockchain addresses to real-world entities so sophisticated users can customize data flows, automate monitoring, and integrate Arkham intelligence into internal systems.

## What You Can Query

Through the API, you can access:

- **Labels and tags** for addresses and entities
- **Transaction activity** (transfers, counterparties, historical flows)
- **Historical balance data** for addresses and entities

::: tip Scale & Coverage
Arkham powers the world's largest blockchain intelligence database:
- **3B+ tags**
- **94% of on-chain volume attributed**
- **$1T+ in labeled asset flows tracked**
:::

## Private Sector Use Cases

The API is designed for organizations that need intelligence for trading, operations, and risk:

- **Trading firms** (market makers, hedge funds, asset managers)
- **Exchanges**, **DeFi protocols**, **payment providers**, and **crypto infrastructure**
- **Risk management** across portfolios, venues, and counterparties
- **Investment strategy** and research (flows, entities, market behavior)
- **Real-time market intelligence** and monitoring (alerts, key wallet tracking)
- **Compliance and fraud** workflows (AML checks, suspicious activity detection, exposure mapping)

## Public Sector Use Cases

The API is designed for mission-driven environments where attribution and traceability matter:

- **Government investigators and analysts**, often in SI- or CSP-hosted environments
- **Systems integrators** embedding attribution into investigative workflows
- **SaaS and data platforms** integrating crypto intelligence into their products
- **Financial crime, sanctions, cybercrime, and fraud** analytics teams

## Getting Access

To use the Arkham API, you'll need:

1. **An Arkham account**
2. **An API plan**
3. **An API key** generated from your Arkham account

## Step 1: Create an Arkham Account

1. Go to [intel.arkm.com](https://intel.arkm.com)
2. Click **Sign Up** in the top-right corner
3. Complete registration and log in

## Step 2: Get an API Plan

Arkham API plans are **custom-built** based on your organization's needs, use cases, and expected usage.

**To request access:**

1. Go to [intel.arkm.com/api](https://intel.arkm.com/api)
2. Scroll to the bottom and complete the short form
3. Submit your details

Our team reviews inbound requests daily and will follow up with either:

- A **tailored proposal** (if you already know your use case and expected usage), or
- **Trial access** so you can evaluate Arkham's data and endpoints before committing

## Step 3: Generate an API Key

Once you have an API plan or trial access, you can generate and manage keys directly in the Arkham platform:

1. Go to [intel.arkm.com/settings](https://intel.arkm.com/settings) (while signed in)
2. Navigate to the **API / Developer** section
3. Create, view, or manage your keys

::: info Key Limits
By default, accounts with API access can create **up to 5 API keys**. On custom plans, this limit can be increased as needed.
:::

You can manage your keys from the settings page at any time, including **naming**, **deleting**, and **rotating** keys.

## API Keys & Authentication

In the Arkham User Interface:

1. Go to **Settings** → scroll to **API Keys**
2. Click **Create key**
3. **Name** the key (e.g., `prod-backend`, `staging`, `research-laptop`)
4. Copy it **once** and store it securely (password manager / secret manager)

::: warning Store Securely
Your API key is only shown once. Store it immediately in a secure location.
:::

## Using the API Key

All API requests **must** include a valid `API-Key` header. Requests without it will be rejected as unauthorized.

**Header format:**

```
API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

**Example (curl):**

```bash
curl -H "API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" "https://api.arkm.com/..."
```

## Multiple Keys

Yes, you can have multiple keys. **Best practice:**

- Separate keys per **environment** (prod / staging / dev)
- Separate keys per **service** (backend / analytics job / partner integration)

This makes rotation and incident containment much easier.

## Rotating or Revoking Keys

1. Create a **new** key
2. Deploy it and confirm requests succeed
3. Revoke the **old** key in the dashboard

## REST vs WebSocket

The Arkham API offers two kinds of endpoints:

  REST (HTTPS)
  Lookups, history, analytics, enrichment

  WebSocket (streaming)
  Real-time updates, live feeds, events

### When to Use REST

- Historical data
- Deterministic queries
- Batch jobs and enrichment
- Easy retry logic

### When to Use WebSocket

- Low-latency updates
- Continuous streaming without polling
- Event-driven systems

::: tip
WebSockets are for "what's changing right now"; REST is for "give me the full state / history."
:::

## Addresses, Entities, Labels

  Address
  A single on-chain address (wallet or contract)
  `0x1234...abcd`

  Entity
  A set of addresses attributed to the same real-world actor
  Binance, BlackRock, Uniswap

**Entities are the "who". Addresses are the "where".**

## Labels

**Labels** are identity metadata Arkham attaches to an address or entity (e.g., "Binance", "BlackRock", "Chainlink"). Labels are designed to answer the most important question in blockchain analysis:

> **Who is behind this activity?**

Labels let users interpret transactions quickly without manually investigating every trail on-chain.

## Tags

**Tags** are qualitative descriptors that summarize the **type** or **behavior** of an address/entity, whether it is labeled or not.

**Examples:**
- "Fund"
- "BTC Whale"
- "OFAC Sanctioned"
- "Hacker"
- "Banned by USDT"
- "High Transacting"

Tags are useful for filtering, discovery, and grouping similar actors.

## Label Types & Confidence

Arkham provides two label types:

### 1. Arkham Verified Labels

Verified labels represent Arkham's highest-confidence attribution.

- **How to identify:** Displayed with a **blue badge** on the Arkham platform
- **Confidence:** Very high (internally thresholded, typically **≥98%**)

::: tip
Use verified labels when you need maximum attribution reliability.
:::

### 2. Entity Predictions

Entity Prediction labels are programmatically generated to identify addresses likely connected to a known entity.

- **How to identify:** Displayed with a **pink badge**, often with a question mark
- **Confidence:** Lower than verified (internally thresholded, typically **≥80%**)

::: warning
Prediction labels are valuable for expanding coverage and spotting relationships, but should be treated as **probabilistic attribution** rather than certainty.
:::

## Entity Composition Changes

Entity composition can change as new attribution is discovered and additional addresses are linked.

Arkham's attribution database is continuously updated:
- New entities are added
- Existing entities expand as new addresses are identified
- In rare cases, attribution may be corrected

For enterprise users, Arkham offers API access to monitor database updates in near real time.

## Private Labels

Arkham doesn't have a label you know about? You can add **private labels** via both the UI and the API.

Private labels are visible only to:
- Your account/workspace
- Anyone you explicitly share access with

With private labels you can:
- Create a new custom entity
- Add addresses to an existing entity
- Manage your private data via the [Labels page](https://intel.arkm.com/labels)

::: info Privacy
Arkham does not access or publish users' private labels.
:::

## How Arkham Labels Wallets

Arkham labels wallets by combining **on-chain behavior** with **public off-chain signals**, running that through our proprietary attribution system (**ULTRA**), and only publishing labels when they meet strict confidence thresholds.

## The Process (High Level)

### 1. Data Ingestion (Signals)

  On-chain
  
- Transfers and interactions
- Counterparty networks
- Contract behavior
- Timing patterns
  

  Off-chain (public)
  
- Public disclosures
- Official wallet posts
- Protocol docs
- Exchange/protocol announcements
- Public attribution sources
  

### 2. Attribution & Clustering (ULTRA)

ULTRA applies a mix of:

- **Address clustering** - linking related addresses
- **Address modeling** - behavioral patterns
- **ML-driven heuristics** - probabilistic attribution
- **Intelligence augmentation** - enrichment from external public signals
- **Internal consistency checks** - across multiple data sources

### 3. Confidence Gating

  Verified labels
  ≥98%

  Prediction labels
  ≥80%

Prediction labels are explicitly marked as lower-confidence.

### 4. Human Verification

Labels that are high visibility or high impact can be reviewed **case-by-case** by analysts before publication.

## Why This Matters

Labeling isn't a single "source of truth" problem. It's a **signal fusion** problem: ULTRA combines multiple independent signals and only publishes attribution when the evidence crosses defined confidence thresholds.

This approach provides:

- **Accuracy** - High confidence thresholds reduce false positives
- **Coverage** - ML-driven predictions expand coverage beyond manual labeling
- **Transparency** - Confidence scoring lets you decide how to weight attribution
- **Adaptability** - Continuous updates as new signals emerge

## Rate Limits

Yes. Rate limits vary by plan and may also depend on the endpoint type (REST vs WebSocket).

Arkham API endpoints generally fall into two categories:

  Standard
  Most endpoints, with small burst allowance
  **20 requests/second**

  Heavy
  Resource-intensive endpoints
  **1 request/second**

Both limits can be **scaled up** under custom API plans.

## Increasing Your Limits

If you need higher limits for a specific endpoint or across your entire plan, contact [api@arkm.com](mailto:api@arkm.com).

## What Happens When You Hit Limits

If you exceed your limit, requests are rejected with:

- **HTTP 429** (Too Many Requests)
- A "too many requests" error response

## Avoiding Rate Limits

Best practices for staying within limits:

1. **Cache** responses when possible
2. **Paginate correctly** (don't repeatedly hit the first page)
3. Use **bulk endpoints** where available
4. Implement **retries with exponential backoff + jitter** on 429

### Backoff Example (Python)

```python
import time
import random
import requests

def request_with_backoff(url, headers, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if resp.status_code == 429:
            # Get retry delay from header, or use exponential backoff
            retry_after = int(resp.headers.get('Retry-After', 2 ** attempt))
            # Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
            jitter = random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(retry_after + jitter)
            continue
        return resp
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

::: tip
Always add jitter to your backoff delays to prevent synchronized retry storms.
:::

## Credit Pricing

Every API request consumes **credits** from your monthly allowance. The cost depends on the endpoint and, for some endpoints, the amount of data returned.

  Per-Call
  Fixed credit cost each time you call the endpoint
  **Credits = weight**

  Per-Row
  Credits scale with the number of results returned
  **Credits = weight × rows returned**

::: info
Failed requests (4xx/5xx responses) are not charged.
:::

## Monitoring Your Usage

You can track your credit consumption in real time on the [API Dashboard](https://intel.arkm.com/api-dashboard). The dashboard shows per-endpoint breakdowns, hourly usage trends, and remaining credits for your billing period.

## Need Help?

For questions about credit usage, custom pricing, or plan upgrades, contact [api@arkm.com](mailto:api@arkm.com).

## Pagination

The Arkham API uses **offset-based pagination**:

- **`limit`** — Maximum results per page (defaults vary by endpoint)
- **`offset`** — Number of results to skip (default: 0)

Responses include `count` or `total` showing total matching records.

## Pagination Limits by Endpoint

  `/transfers`
  Default: 20 · Max: No hard cap · *50-500 recommended*

  `/swaps`
  Default: 50 · Max: No hard cap · *50-500 recommended*

  `/counterparties/*`
  Default: 1000 · Max: **1000** · *Hard limit enforced*

  `/tokens`
  Default: 100 · Max: 250

  `/tag/{id}/params`
  Default: 100 · Max: 1000

::: warning Why 50-500 recommended?
Large result sets increase response time and credit cost. Elasticsearch queries have internal timeouts (~20s for complex queries), and performance might degrade above ~1000 results.
:::

## Iterating Through Results

### Option 1: Offset-Based (Simple)

Simple but may miss/duplicate items if data changes during pagination:

```python
offset, all_results = 0, []

while True:
    resp = api.get_transfers(limit=50, offset=offset)
    all_results.extend(resp['transfers'])

    if len(resp['transfers']) < 50:
        break
    offset += 50
```

### Option 2: Time-Window Sliding (Consistent)

For frequently-changing data, page by time windows instead of offsets:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

window_end = datetime.utcnow()
window_size = timedelta(hours=1)
all_results = []

while window_end > earliest_date:
    window_start = window_end - window_size

    resp = api.get_transfers(
        timeGte=int(window_start.timestamp() * 1000),
        timeLte=int(window_end.timestamp() * 1000),
        limit=500
    )

    all_results.extend(resp['transfers'])
    window_end = window_start  # slide window back
```

::: tip
Time-window sliding eliminates duplicates and missed records caused by new data arriving during pagination.
:::

## Timestamps & Sorting

### Absolute (Unix milliseconds)

```
?timeGte=1696630274000&timeLte=1696716674000
```

### Relative Duration

```
?timeLast=24h
```

Also supports: `7d`, `30d`, `1M`, `1y`

::: danger
Cannot combine `timeLast` with `timeGte`/`timeLte` — returns HTTP 400.
:::

## Sorting

- **`sortKey`** — `time` (default), `value`, `usd`
- **`sortDir`** — `desc` (default), `asc`

**Example:**

```
GET /transfers?sortKey=usd&sortDir=desc&timeLast=24h
```

## Time Handling Notes

- All timestamps are **UTC**
- `timeLast` is calculated from server time at request
- `/portfolio` time parameter is truncated to **UTC midnight**

## Errors & HTTP Codes

- **200** — Success
- **400** — Bad request (invalid params)
- **401** — Unauthorized (API key issue)
- **402** — Payment required
- **403** — Forbidden (endpoint not in plan)
- **404** — Not found
- **429** — Rate limit exceeded
- **500** — Server error

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{"error": "description"}
```

## Common Errors

  `"error validating API key"` (401)
  Check key, use `API-Key` header (not `Authorization`)

  `"not allowed to access endpoint"` (403)
  Contact api@arkm.com for plan upgrade

  `"cannot use timeLast and timeGte together"`
  Use one or the other, not both

  `"limit must be between 1 and 1000"`
  Reduce limit (counterparties max: 1000)

## Rate Limit Handling (429)

When you receive a 429, implement backoff:

```python
import time
import requests

def request_with_backoff(url, headers, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if resp.status_code == 429:
            time.sleep(int(resp.headers.get('Retry-After', 60)))
            continue
        return resp
```

## WebSocket Errors

WebSocket errors are returned in this format:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "payload": {
    "code": "INVALID_FILTER",
    "message": "..."
  }
}
```

### Error Codes

- **`INVALID_PAYLOAD`** — Malformed request
- **`INVALID_FILTER`** — Invalid filter parameters
- **`INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`** — Out of credits
- **`TIER_RATE_LIMITED`** — Rate limit for your tier

### Credit Exhaustion

When credits are exhausted:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "payload": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS",
    "limitType": "hourly",
    "resetIn": 1800
  }
}
```

- **`code`** — `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` or `TIER_RATE_LIMITED`
- **`limitType`** — Which limit: `minutely`, `hourly`, or `monthly`
- **`resetIn`** — Seconds until the limit resets

## Security & Best Practices

### DO

- Store in environment variables or secrets manager
- Use separate keys per environment (prod / staging / dev)
- Use separate keys per service (backend / analytics / partner)
- Rotate periodically
- Always use header: `API-Key: YOUR_KEY`

### DON'T

- Commit to version control
- Put in URLs as query parameters
- Log in plaintext
- Share across organizations
- Expose in client-side code

## Query Optimization

### 1. Add Filters to Reduce Result Size

```
?chain=ethereum&usdGte=10000&timeLast=24h
```

### 2. Use Appropriate Time Windows

- **Real-time monitoring** → `1h` or less
- **Daily analysis** → `24h`
- **Historical research** → `30d`

### 3. Implement Caching

- **Intelligence data** → Hours
- **Historical transfers** → Indefinitely
- **Balances** → Minutes

## WebSocket Best Practices

1. **Always include filters** — use `from`, `to`, `tokens`, or `usdGte >= 10M`
2. **Save `sessionId`** for reconnection (valid 5 minutes)
3. **Implement ping/pong heartbeat** to detect disconnections

### WebSocket Quotas

WebSocket connections consume credits based on:

- **Connection time**: Charged per minute of active connection
- **Transfer notifications**: Charged per notification (weight varies by plan)

**Quota tiers:**

- Per-minute (burst protection)
- Per-hour
- Per-month

### Recovery After Disconnection

- Events are **buffered for 5 minutes** during disconnection
- Reconnect using `sessionId` to restore filters and receive pending notifications
- After 5 minutes, session expires and buffered events are discarded

## Production Checklist

Before going to production, verify:

- [ ] API keys stored in secrets manager (not in code)
- [ ] Client-side rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Exponential backoff for 429/5xx errors
- [ ] Error handling for all HTTP status codes
- [ ] Request logging enabled (without secrets)
- [ ] Monitoring for 429/5xx rates
- [ ] Caching strategy per endpoint type
- [ ] Separate keys per environment

## Evidentiary Usage

Arkham provides **investigative intelligence** designed to accelerate attribution, triage, and on-chain analysis. It is intended to support investigations and decision-making, not to serve as standalone evidence.

::: warning
Customers are responsible for corroborating findings and meeting their own legal, regulatory, and evidentiary standards.
:::

Arkham emphasizes:
- **Confidence-scored attribution**
- **Auditability and transparency**
- Clear explanations of why labels exist and how they were derived

## Cookbook & Starter Kits

This page provides ready-to-use tools and code examples to help you start using the Arkham API quickly. Whether you prefer a visual interface, copy-paste code snippets, or full command-line tools, we have options for different workflows.

**What's here:**
- **Postman Collection** — Import into Postman and start making requests immediately, no coding required
- **Code Snippets** — Minimal Python and curl examples you can copy directly into your projects

All tools come pre-configured with example addresses and sensible defaults so you can test the API right away.

## Postman Collection

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a free API client that lets you explore and test APIs without writing code. It's the fastest way to start making requests — just import our collection, add your API key, and click Send.

**What you get:** 50+ pre-configured endpoints organized by use case (Compliance, Trading, Investigation, etc.)

::: warning WebSocket Limitation
Postman cannot stream WebSocket data. For real-time transfer streaming, use the [Python code snippet](#websocket-stream-real-time-transfers) below.

## Quick Code Examples

### REST: Get Address Intelligence

**Python:**
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your-api-key"
address = "0x28C6c06298d514Db089934071355E5743bf21d60"  # Binance

response = requests.get(
    f"https://api.arkm.com/intelligence/address/{address}",
    headers={"API-Key": API_KEY}
)
print(response.json())
```

**curl:**
```bash
curl -H "API-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://api.arkm.com/intelligence/address/0x28C6c06298d514Db089934071355E5743bf21d60"
```

### REST: Get Recent Transfers

**Python:**
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your-api-key"

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.arkm.com/transfers",
    headers={"API-Key": API_KEY},
    params={
        "base": "0x28C6c06298d514Db089934071355E5743bf21d60",  # Binance
        "timeLast": "1h",
        "limit": 10
    }
)
print(response.json())
```

**curl:**
```bash
curl -H "API-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://api.arkm.com/transfers?base=0x28C6c06298d514Db089934071355E5743bf21d60&timeLast=1h&limit=10"
```

### WebSocket: Stream Real-Time Transfers

The Arkham API includes WebSocket endpoints for subscribing to real-time event feeds. This example connects to the transfers WebSocket and streams CEX withdrawals above $10k as they happen on-chain.

::: tip Filter Requirement
WebSocket subscriptions require at least one of: `from`, `to`, `tokens`, or `usdGte >= 10,000,000`.
:::

::: info Latency Note
The first transfer after subscribing may take up to 90 seconds, depending on how quickly a matching transfer occurs.
:::

```python
import asyncio
import json
import ssl
import websockets

API_KEY = "your-api-key"

# WARNING: This disables SSL verification for easier local testing.
# For production use, remove these lines and use default SSL verification.
ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context()
ssl_context.check_hostname = False
ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

async def stream_transfers():
    url = "wss://api.arkm.com/ws/transfers"
    headers = {"API-Key": API_KEY}

    async with websockets.connect(url, additional_headers=headers, ssl=ssl_context) as ws:
        # Subscribe to transfers from CEXs >= $10k
        subscribe_msg = {
            "id": "1",
            "type": "subscribe",
            "payload": {
                "filters": {
                    "from": ["type:cex"],
                    "usdGte": 10000
                }
            }
        }
        await ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_msg))

        # Wait for ACK
        ack = await ws.recv()
        print("Subscribed:", json.loads(ack))

        # Stream transfers
        async for message in ws:
            data = json.loads(message)
            if data.get("type") == "transfer":
                transfer = data["payload"]["transfer"]
                print(f"${transfer['historicalUSD']:,.0f} {transfer['tokenSymbol']} on {transfer['chain']}")

asyncio.run(stream_transfers())
```

## WebSocket Filter Reference

When subscribing to the WebSocket, you can filter transfers by:

- `usdGte` (number) — Minimum USD value
- `usdLte` (number) — Maximum USD value
- `chains` (string[]) — List of blockchains
- `from` (string[]) — Source addresses or entity names
- `to` (string[]) — Destination addresses or entity names
- `tokens` (string[]) — Token symbols or addresses

**Filter Requirements:**
You must include at least one of:
- `from`, `to`, or `tokens` filter, **OR**
- `usdGte >= 10,000,000` (10 million USD)

**Rate Limits:**
- 10,000 transfers per hour
- 1,000,000 transfers per month

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Error validating API key | Check your key is correct. Use `API-Key` header, not `Authorization`. |
| Filter requirement not met | WebSocket needs `from`, `to`, `tokens`, or `usdGte` ≥ 10M |
| HTTP 401 Unauthorized | Invalid or expired API key |
| HTTP 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limited — implement backoff, reduce request frequency |
